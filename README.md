Understanding housing prices is a critical area of interest for various stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, and policymakers. 
The goal of this report is to develop a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on key features such as the size of the 
house, its age, and overall quality. Using a synthetic dataset, this report explores the relationships between features and the target variable 
(SalePrice) and evaluates the performance of multiple machine learning models.
